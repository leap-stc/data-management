# What is the LEAP Data Catalog?

The LEAP Data Catalog is a centralized repository that consolidates various LEAP datasets into a single JSON file. This JSON catalog is generated from individual YAML files, each representing a dataset.

> [!NOTE]
> See [leap-stc/leap-data-management-utils](https://github.com/leap-stc/leap-data-management-utils/blob/main/docs/catalog.md) for more information about the schema of the catalog and how to create catalog entries.
